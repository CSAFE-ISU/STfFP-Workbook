# Introduction

This workbook is intended to accompany the Statistical Thinking for Forensic Practitioners workshop taught by members of the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE). The slides for this workshop were constructed initially by Dr. Hal Stern of UC-Irvine and Dr. Alicia Carriquiry of Iowa State University. 

When taking the workshop, please follow along with the slides handout (if given) and this workbook. The workbook contains the same material as the slides, with room for you to take notes and to fill in the missing material.
